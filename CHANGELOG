## 20150708
- Moved changes from README.md to new CHANGELOG file.
- Updated README.md
- Replaced `tedroden/trim-line` with `bp/trim-line` which uses `delete-trailing-whitespace`
- Removed extra newline from `taskpaper-create-new-project`.
- Chanced `taskpaper-toggle-task-done` from just deleting the `-` at the beginning
  of the line to adding/removing @done(datestamp) from the end of the line.

## 20150707
- Fixed the "mark as done" function to append "@done([datestamp])" to the item.

## 20150625
- You can set the priority arbitrarily high, but once you get to level 10,
  you get a second @priority tag with a new set of numbers.
- Added customizable priority levels. There is no sanity checking on this yet.

## 20150619
- Anything other than whitepace after the `:` on a project line will cause it
  to not be a project anymore.
- Remove the "Create new task" key binding. It conflicts with the
  "Focus on today", and there are plenty of other ways to accomplish
  the same thing.
- Change the face of Projects to be bold monospace.
- Change the face of "done" items to be lighter -- it's unreadable on dark
  backgrounds.
- Updated the logic so that the "project" face is used when a line ends with
  a `:`, but the item still "behaves" like a task.
